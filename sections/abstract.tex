At the age of online information abundance, the human capacity to retain knowledge is largely limited by the time and the attention required to read text, watch videos, listen to podcasts. For written information, rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) helps greatly save time with similar levels of text understanding, compared with traditional reading. However, RSVP does not account for attention. We present a simple hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) that controls in real-time the speed of reading by measuring the instant level of higher cognitive brain activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is acquired with a single channel consumer-grade headset and analyzed in the frequency domain. The pace of word display is controlled by a measure brainwave entropy. We have conducted a controlled experiment with 50 subjects with three distinct treatments, and we show that brain-controlled speed-reading increases the speed and the understanding of texts by subjects.
