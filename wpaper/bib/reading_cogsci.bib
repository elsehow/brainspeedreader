  abstract = {The effects of sentential context and semantic memory structure during on-line sentence processing were examined by recording event-related brain potentials as individuals read pairs of sentences for comprehension. The first sentence established an expectation for a particular exemplar of a semantic category, while the second ended with (1) that expected exemplar, (2) an unexpected exemplar from the same (expected) category, or (3) an unexpected item from a different (unexpected) category. Expected endings elicited a positivity between 250 and 550 ms while all unexpected endings elicited an N400, which was significantly smaller to items from the expected category. This N400 reduction varied with the strength of the contextually induced expectation: unexpected, categorically related endings elicited smaller N400s in more constraining contexts, despite their poorer fit to context (lower plausibility). This pattern of effects is best explained as reflecting the impact of context-independent long-term memory structure on sentence processing. The results thus suggest that physical and functional similarities that hold between objects in the world—i.e., category structure—influence neural organization and, in turn, routine language comprehension processes.}

  abstract = {A number of experiments explored the hypothesis that immediate memory span is not constant, but varies with the length of the words to be recalled. Results showed: (1) Memory span is inversely related to word length across a wide range of materials; (2) When number of syllables and number of phonemes are held constant, words of short temporal duration are better recalled than words of long duration; (3) Span could be predicted on the basis of the number of words which the subject can read in approximately 2 sec; (4) When articulation is suppressed by requiring the subject to articulate an irrelevant sound, the word length effect disappears with visual presentation, but remains when presentation is auditory. The results are interpreted in terms of a phonemically-based store of limited temporal capacity, which may function as an output buffer for speech production, and as a supplement to a more central working memory system.}

  abstract = {To account for the large demands on working memory during text comprehension and expert performance, the traditional models of working memory involving temporary storage must be extended to include working memory based on storage in long-term memory. In the proposed theoretical framework cognitive processes are viewed as a sequence of stable states representing end products of processing. In skilled activities, acquired memory skills allow these end products to be stored in long-term memory and kept directly accessible by means of retrieval cues in short-term memory, as proposed by skilled memory theory. These theoretical claims are supported by a review of evidence on memory in text comprehension and expert performance in such domains as mental calculation, medical diagnosis, and chess.}

  abstract = {Individual differences in reading correlate with individual differences in perception, in memory, and in other simple processes. This study measured these relationships using information processing tasks such as visual search, visual matching, and span of apprehension; and using linguistic processing tasks such as word-nonword judgment, picture-sentence verification, and semantic categorization. These tasks were performed by a large sample of college students chosen to represent the full range of college-level reading ability. Three salient findings emerged: (a) Reading correlates with the information processing measures when they involve words, but it does not correlate with otherwise identical measures involving letters. (b) Reading speed and comprehension have different correlations with the information processing measures, although they have similar correlations with the linguistic processing measures. (c) Reading speed is only moderately correlated with listening comprehension, but reading comprehension ability is indistinguishable from listening comprehension ability. These results indicate that reading speed and comprehension depend on abilities that are at least partly distinct. Specifically, reading speed varies with visual word processing, while reading comprehension varies with non-visual linguistic processing.}

  abstract = {Individual differences in reading comprehension may reflect differences in working memory capacity, specifically in the trade-off between its processing and storage functions. A poor reader's processes may be inefficient, so that they lessen the amount of additional information that can be maintained in working memory. A test with heavy processing and storage demands was devised to measure this trade-off. Subjects read aloud a series of sentences and then recalled the final word of each sentence. The reading span, the number of final words recalled, varied from two to five for 20 college students. This span correlated with three reading comprehension measures, including verbal SAT and tests involving fact retrieval and pronominal reference. Similar correlations were obtained with a listening span task, showing that the correlation is not specific to reading. These results were contrasted with traditional digit span and word span measures which do not correlate with comprehension.}

  abstract = {Fast readers and average readers were tested on four tasks. Neither peripheral letter identification nor susceptibility of foveal letter identification to patterned masking differed between the two groups. However, fast readers appear to pick up more information per fixation on structured textual material, as indexed by a forced-choice test. Furthermore, the average fast reader had a greater span of apprehension for unrelated elements. It appears that faster readers are able to encode more of the contents of each fixation, whether or not higher order linguistic structure is present. The results are inconsistent with the view that reading speed is dependent solely on the reader's ability to infer or fill in missing information.}
