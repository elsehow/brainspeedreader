Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is widely used for speed reading, as well as a powerful way to probe human cognition. However, lack of online, fast and seamless control of RSVP speed has remained a bottleneck in the broader development of this technology. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) constitute the fastest possible channel to control a computer device ``directly from the mind". Meaningful electroencephalography (EEG) signal is usually transmitted in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. In this study, we leverage EEG for the purpose of seamlessly controlling speed reading. We use a lightweight bio-feedback mechanism, that allows real-time processing of EEG signal, which in turn is used to set the speed of the RSVP. We first evaluate how participants manage to control the speed reader through the EEG signal transmitted to the computer device. We then assess the  comfort, understanding and speed gains provided by the {\it Brainspeedr}.
