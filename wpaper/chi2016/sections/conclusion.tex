\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
We have demonstrated the feasibility of a {\it brain speed reader} based on a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) controlled through EEG signal acquired with consumer grade device. For that, we have rationalized results in cognitive and neuroscience, associated with language processing. We have found support for XX, confirming XX, yet with a simple apparatus, which can be tested by anyone.

We can conclude than indeed, Miss Potter \cite{potter1989} was right saying that a control mechanism would help RSVP reading.
