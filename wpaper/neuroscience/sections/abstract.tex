Neurofeedback is most often associated with cognitive remediation and enhancement \cite{}. It is however less often used for understanding the dynamics of cognition. By coupling EEG signal to a time-varying rapid serial visual presentation (tRSVP) mechanism, and observing that people tend to achieve high control of tRSVP, we show how people's brains develop strategies to tackle fast paced presented stimuli of various difficulty.
