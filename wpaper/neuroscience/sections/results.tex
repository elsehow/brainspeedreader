\section{Results}
\label{results}


For $17$ over $21$ participants, the RSVP rate was characterized by a balanced joint probability of {\it rate change x word size frequency} in treatment (ii) and (iii) (Fig. 2a). Long words triggered the largest change of entropy (resp. rate), while words smaller than the average size ( $< 5.5$ characters) were associated with reverse entropy (resp. rate) change (Fig. 2b, 2c).\\

Despite the large variation of entropy, texts could be decoded by matching the sequence of entropy measures (associated with each word) with the unique sequence of word lengths (Fig 3). Our results did not require preliminary identification of participants, and the success rate was 27.4\%, roughly 11\% above chance (i.e., $1/6 \approx 16.67\%$), when considering the first 300 words of each text.



\begin{itemize}
  \item performance*, perceived comfort and control as a function of treatment 
  \item for brain speed reader treatment:  performance*, perceived comfort and control as a function $X_0$, $alpha$
\end{itemize}

*performance means either {\bf conceptual} (understanding the meaning), {\bf conceptual-memory} (recalling characters) or {\bf memory} (recalling some words).
