\section{Apparatus}
The brain speed-reader is an apparatus, which displays words on a screen at variable $r(t)$, which in turn is read by the user. The reading task triggers a change of brain activity, which can be recorded and analyzed through electroencephalograms (EEG). As our apparatus is conceived for use in a naturalistic environment, we have used, {\it Neurosky Mindwave}, the cheapest consumer-grade EEG headset available for less than \$100 on the market. As shown on Figure \ref{fig:apparatus} and explained step-by-step below, the EEG signal is processed online, in order to adapt the rate of words displayed as function of cognitive activity: if the rate $r$ is too large (resp. too low) at time $t$, then reading triggers more  (resp. less) cognitive activity, which in turn allows reducing (resp. increasing) $r$ at $t+1$. In this section, we explain step-by-step the design of the apparatus in details.

\subsection{Rate of Word Display}
The principle of {\it Rapid Serial Visual Presentation} (RVSP) applied to text, is precisely to display the words of a text at a controlled rate. However, in most RVSP implementations for text, the rate of word display pre-determined and remains constant. In our implementation, the user first calibrates the brain speed-reader by tuning a comfortable baseline word display rate $r_{baseline} = r(t = 0)$. The operation takes only a few seconds. This is a usual way to proceed when using usual text RVSP applications.

\subsection{Brain Activity as Captured by EEG signal}
Unlike traditional text RVSP, we wish to let the user adapt the rate of word display in real-time, through brain activity as captured by EEG signal, to control for a text becoming suddenly becoming more difficult, or just because the mindset of the user has changed, like sudden focus on an important part of the text (lower rate desired) or, on the contrary, loss of attention (higher rate of word displayed desired).

Because we want our apparatus be usable outside the lab, we have chosen the cheapest consumer-grade EEG scanner, available on the market for less than \$100.

\subsection{EEG Signal Processing}
One way to process the EEG signal, consists in analyzing its spectral properties over a determined period. Here, we take a time window of 0.25 second, which allows us to analyze the frequency domain $0-128Hz$, since the sampling rate of the Neurosky Mindwave is 512 measures per second (i.e., 512 Hz). Hence, every 0.25 second, we compute the power spectrum given by, 

 \begin{equation}
\label{eq:pspectrum}
\mathbf{[pspectrum~here]}
\end{equation}
 
and which is expected to approximately follow a power law, i.e., the probability to find a frequency $x$ is given by the probability density function $pdf(x)  = 1/x^{\mu+1}$. The power spectrum varies as a function of the mental tasks occurring, and potential external perturbations, such as voice, imperceptible and perceptible muscle movements, eye-movement, blinking.

\end{figure}


Then, entropy.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tsallis}
S_q(X) = \frac{1}{q-1} \left( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n (p_i)^q \right).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:shannon}
S_1(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\cdot log_{2}(p_i), ~~for~~q=1.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Why Entropy ?}

higher frequencies are usually associated to higher cognitive brain activation. Higher activation  translated into larger entropy $S$.


We wanted a lightweight mobile apparatus, which does not require complicated machine learning or any communication with a cloud service, or would not drain a battery. We purposely decided for a cheap update method {\bf [continue this point in discussion because it helps introduce future work]}

One could argue that we could have taken the {\it meditation} and {\it attention} metrics provided by Neurosky (and computed directly in the headset). However, these metrics are proprietary and their formula kept secret (we suspect nevertheless that they take $\alpha$ and $\beta$ waves  as an input). Furthermore, extensive testing did not allow us find any consistency with what we would quality meditation or attention. As a result, we preferred to stick to the principles of reproducible science.

\subsection{Negative Feedback Loop}

Explain: higher cog. activity  $\rightarrow$  higher entropy $\rightarrow$  lower word display rate $\rightarrow$ lower cog. activity. {\bf [probably not worth a section]}


\subsection{Word Display Rate Update}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Snormalized}
S_{norm}(t) = \frac{S(t) - \langle S \rangle}{\sigma_{S}}, 
\end{equation}
with $\langle S \rangle$ and $\sigma_{S}$ the average and standard deviation of the entropy $S$ calculated over the last 20 points (i.e., the last 5 seconds?). The normalization ensures that $S_{norm}$ is always centered around $0$. The rate $R(t+1)$ of word display is then updated as follows,

\begin{equation}
R(t+\Delta t) = R(t) \left[1 - \alpha \cdot S_{norm}(t)\right],
\label{eq:RateChange}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta t = 0.25$ seconds and $\alpha = 0.20$. In other words, the normalized entropy influences for 20\% the rate change $\Delta R =  \left[ R(t+\Delta t) - R(t) \right] / R(t) = - \alpha \cdot S_{norm}(t)$. Increasing $\alpha$ increases the influence of $S_{norm}$, and the negative sign ensures control of $R$ with a mean reverting process. Note however, that since $S_{norm}$ is calculated from a moving average on a rather short time window, $R$ exhibits excursions (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:trajectory}).
